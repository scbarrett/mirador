# The Mirador Model Merger

This project is concerned with re-architecting the *software model merging* research tool, **Mirador**, as a Web-based application. Adding a browser front-end and putting it out on the Internet will make it more accessible, and give its novel features more exposure. It will also provide an opportunity to address issues neglected in the original research, and to branch into areas never considered.

The prototype **Mirador** validated the *hybrid merging process* at the core of my [doctoral thesis](http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/7368/) done at [Concordia University](http://encs.concordia.ca/) in Montreal. Being a prototype, it was purposefully limited in its capabilities, and in the problems that it attacked. The new version proposes to lift that limitation and expand those capabilities.
